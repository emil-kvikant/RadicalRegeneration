                <div class="manifesto-footnote">
                    <p>* For the more theoretically versed comrades among us: Under confederal communalism we choose to understand a reflexive socialism in the Bourdieuian sense:
                    "[â€¦] reflexivity inclines one to an integrative position which consists in bracketing-off in particular what the opposing theories may owe to the fictious pursuit of difference."
                    Hence under confederal communalism we unite all socialisms that proactively struggle for feminism, ecology, direct democracy, indigenous wisdom and solidarity: I.e. AnarchaFeminism, Ecosocialism, Feministmarxism, Ecomarxism, EcoFeminism, EcoAnarchism, Communalism, libertarian socialism, indigenous and peasant movements, Social Ecology etc.</p>

                    <p>** The term Symbiocene offers a similar vision to D. Harraway's Chthulucene as they both refer to revelations of new symbiotic science, the science of mutually beneficial relationships. The Symbiocene stands for a time in which the predominant worldview is matricentric, animistic, in which order is aspired not through hierarchy and domination but diversity, emergence, cooperation and symbioses. A time when we experience and make sense of the world through living wholing systems thinking. Apart of many indigenous voices, stories and sciences, like among others Lyla Johnston, Raimon Panikkar and Vandava Shiva, Glenn Albrecht offers an extensive philosophical and psycho-social framework and a new terminology for the Symbiocene age in his book Earth Emotions: New Words for a New World.</p>
